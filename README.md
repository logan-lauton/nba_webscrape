### About Me
I am a Senior at [Marquette University](https://www.marquette.edu/data-science/) pursuing a bachelors of science in data science, with minor areas in computer science, economics, & mathematics. Over my academic career at Marquette I have learned how to use many coding languages such as Python, Java, R, SQL, and more all to help me further my understanding of computational analysis. This repository hold the code used to scrape numerous sites to formulate a [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/loganlauton/nba-players-and-team-data).
